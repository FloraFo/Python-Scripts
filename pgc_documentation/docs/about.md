# About Me 👩‍💻

Hi there! I'm a **tech passionate consultant** with over **10 years of experience** in the IT industry. From day one, I've been driven by a strong passion for **data** and its potential to transform businesses. 📊💡

I started my career as a **Business Analyst**, where I quickly realized the power of **Python** to automate and streamline my daily tasks. It wasn’t long before Python became my best friend! 🐍✨ Whether it's building scripts, analyzing data, or creating tools, Python has been a constant companion throughout my journey.

My expertise lies in **Business Intelligence (BI)** and **Data Visualization**, but my curiosity doesn't stop there. I'm currently expanding my knowledge in the fields of **AI** and **Machine Learning**. 🤖📈 The world of AI excites me, and I’m always eager to learn and grow in these areas. That’s why I joined the **CalTech Post-Graduate Program** to get certified in the latest AI and ML technologies. 🎓💡

I believe in **continuous improvement**, a mindset that's perhaps influenced by my experience in **Agile methodologies**. It’s all about staying ahead of the curve, learning new things, and constantly pushing my boundaries. 🚀
