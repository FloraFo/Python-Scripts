## Projects

* [**Personal Expense Traker**](Projects/personalexpstraker.md) -  A Python-based assessment project that allows users to track and manage their personal expenses through an intuitive GUI.



* [**Preserving Heritage and Enhancing Tourism with AI**](Projects/preservingheritage.md) -  This capstone project aims to support cultural heritage preservation and promote tourism by integrating artificial intelligence technologies. The work is divided into two main components: image classification and tourist recommendation.

The first part focuses on deep learning, where I developed an intelligent, automated AI model using TensorFlow. This model is trained on a dataset of heritage site images and is capable of predicting the category or type of structure (e.g., temple, fort, monument) from an image. This classification can assist heritage organizations in digitizing and cataloguing cultural assets efficiently.

The second part uses machine learning to enhance the tourist experience. I performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) on tourism-related data to understand patterns and preferences. Based on these insights, I developed a recommendation engine that suggests heritage sites to tourists according to their interests, previous visits, or location.

Together, these AI-driven solutions aim to make cultural heritage more accessible and engaging while supporting conservation efforts. The project demonstrates how AI can be harnessed to both preserve the past and shape the future of tourism.
