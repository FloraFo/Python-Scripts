# Personal Expense Tracker

## Overview

The **Personal Expense Tracker** is a simple application designed to help users manage their daily expenses. It allows users to track their spending, categorize expenses, and set monthly budgets. With file-handling functionality, the application can save and load data, ensuring that users can easily monitor their financial status over time.

## Features

1. **Expense Management**  
   - Users can input their daily expenses and assign categories (e.g., food, transportation, entertainment, etc.).
  
2. **Budgeting**  
   - Set monthly budgets for different categories, allowing users to track if they are staying within their planned limits.

3. **File Handling**  
   - All data (expenses, categories, and budgets) is saved to a file, so users can easily load and review their expense history.

4. **Interactive Menu**

## How It Works

1. **Adding Expenses**:  
   - Users can enter their expenses by specifying the amount, category, and date.
