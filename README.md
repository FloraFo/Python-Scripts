# AI and ML Projects Repository

Welcome to my repository, where I showcase a collection of my projects related to **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** and **Machine Learning (ML)**. This repository includes various applications, algorithms, and models that I've developed and explored within these fields.

## Contents

This repository includes a wide range of projects, such as:

- **Supervised Learning**: Classification, Regression, and related techniques.
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Clustering, Dimensionality Reduction, etc.
- **Deep Learning**: Neural networks, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), etc.
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Q-learning, Policy Gradient methods, etc.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Text analysis, sentiment analysis, language models, etc.
- **Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering**: Techniques and utilities for preparing data for ML models.
- **Model Evaluation and Hyperparameter Tuning**: Methods for improving and assessing model performance.

Each folder or sub-directory in this repository is dedicated to a specific project, containing relevant code, documentation, and sometimes datasets or results. Feel free to explore, contribute, or ask questions!

## Project Structure

The general structure of each project typically includes:

- `README.md`: Project overview, setup instructions, and usage details.
- `main.py` or `notebook.ipynb`: The core code for the project or Jupyter notebooks showcasing experiments.
- `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies for the project.
- `data/`: Datasets used in the project (if applicable).
- `models/`: Pre-trained models or saved model weights (if applicable).
- `outputs/`: Visualizations, predictions, or results generated by the models.

## Contributions

If you'd like to contribute to any of the projects, feel free to fork the repository, make changes, and submit a pull request. Contributions, suggestions, and feedback are always welcome!
