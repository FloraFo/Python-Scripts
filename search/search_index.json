Preserving Heritage and Enhancing Tourism with AI - This capstone project aims to support cultural heritage preservation and promote tourism by integrating artificial intelligence technologies. The work is divided into two main components: image classification and tourist recommendation. The first part focuses on deep learning, where I developed an intelligent, automated AI model using TensorFlow. This model is trained on a dataset of heritage site images and is capable of predicting the category or type of structure (e.g., temple, fort, monument) from an image. This classification can assist heritage organizations in digitizing and cataloguing cultural assets efficiently. The second part uses machine learning to enhance the tourist experience. I performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) on tourism-related data to understand patterns and preferences. Based on these insights, I developed a recommendation engine that suggests heritage sites to tourists according to their interests, previous visits, or location. Together, these AI-driven solutions aim to make cultural heritage more accessible and engaging while supporting conservation efforts. The project demonstrates how AI can be harnessed to both preserve the past and shape the future of tourism.","title":"Home"},{"location":"#welcome-to-my-ai-ml-projects-showcase","text":"Welcome to my personal website!

It allows users to track their spending, categorize expenses, and set monthly budgets. With file-handling functionality, the application can save and load data, ensuring that users can easily monitor their financial status over time. Features Expense Management Users can input their daily expenses and assign categories (e.g., food, transportation, entertainment, etc.). Budgeting Set monthly budgets for different categories, allowing users to track if they are staying within their planned limits. File Handling All data (expenses, categories, and budgets) is saved to a file, so users can easily load and review their expense history. Interactive Menu The application provides an intuitive, menu-driven interface, making it user-friendly and easy to navigate. How It Works Adding Expenses : Users can enter their expenses by specifying the amount, category, and date. Categorizing Expenses : Each expense is linked to a category for easier analysis, and the application shows how much has been spent in each category. Setting a Budget : Users can set a monthly budget for each category. The tracker compares actual spending against the budgeted amount and alerts the user if they exceed their limit. Saving and Loading Data : Expense and budget data is saved to a file so that users can load their past data upon reopening the app. This ensures that users can continue tracking without losing any information. Benefits Financial Awareness : Helps users understand where their money is going and identify areas to cut back on. Budget Control : Keeps track of budgets and provides alerts if spending exceeds limits. Data Persistence : Saves all entered data to a file, so users don't lose their financial history.

It is divided into two core parts involving both deep learning and machine learning techniques. \ud83d\ude80 Project Objectives 1. Heritage Structure Classification with TensorFlow \ud83e\udde0 Using TensorFlow , I developed a deep learning model to classify historical structures based on images. Leveraging transfer learning with a pre-trained CNN backbone, the model was fine-tuned to predict the category of heritage structures (e.g., temples, forts, monuments). Key steps included: - Image preprocessing and augmentation - Transfer learning using frozen convolutional layers - Fine-tuning the top dense layers with dropout regularization - Model training with validation accuracy monitoring - Visualization of training metrics to detect overfitting 2. Tourist Recommendation Engine with EDA \ud83d\udcca For the second part, I used machine learning and EDA to build a personalized tourist recommendation engine . This included: - Data cleaning and exploratory data analysis on user demographics and location preferences - Insights on the most visited and highly rated tourist places - Development of a collaborative filtering model to suggest attractions based on user behavior \ud83d\udcc2 Datasets Used Structures_dataset.zip \u2013 Images of historical structures Dataseet_test \u2013 Images of historical structures for validation user.csv , tourism_with_id.csv , tourism_rating.csv \u2013 User demographics and tourism activity \ud83d\udca1 Outcome The combined AI solutions automate heritage categorization and intelligently connect tourists with culturally rich destinations, supporting both preservation and sustainable tourism.","title":"\ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f Capstone Project: Preserving Heritage \u2013 Enhancing Tourism with AI"},{"location":"Projects/preservingheritage/#capstone-project-preserving-heritage-enhancing-tourism-with-ai","text":"This capstone project addresses a dual challenge: preserving historical heritage through automation and enhancing the tourist experience through intelligent recommendations.
