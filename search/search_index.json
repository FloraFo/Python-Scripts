It allows users to track their spending, categorize expenses, and set monthly budgets. With file-handling functionality, the application can save and load data, ensuring that users can easily monitor their financial status over time. Features Expense Management Users can input their daily expenses and assign categories (e.g., food, transportation, entertainment, etc.). Budgeting Set monthly budgets for different categories, allowing users to track if they are staying within their planned limits.

Interactive Menu The application provides an intuitive, menu-driven interface, making it user-friendly and easy to navigate. How It Works Adding Expenses : Users can enter their expenses by specifying the amount, category, and date. Categorizing Expenses : Each expense is linked to a category for easier analysis, and the application shows how much has been spent in each category. Setting a Budget : Users can set a monthly budget for each category. The tracker compares actual spending against the budgeted amount and alerts the user if they exceed their limit. Saving and Loading Data : Expense and budget data is saved to a file so that users can load their past data upon reopening the app. This ensures that users can continue tracking without losing any information. Benefits Financial Awareness : Helps users understand where their money is going and identify areas to cut back on. Budget Control : Keeps track of budgets and provides alerts if spending exceeds limits. Data Persistence : Saves all entered data to a file, so users don't lose their financial history. User-Friendly Interface : The interactive menu ensures ease of use, even for those with minimal technical experience.
